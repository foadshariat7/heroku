              </h2>
              <p>I was born and raised in Isfahan, Iran, a UNESCO World Heritage Site known for its beautiful architecture. My love of design, nurtured and inspired by the beauty that surrounded me as a child, has carried over into my life today within the natural wonders of the Seattle area. My approach is also informed by my 15 years as a medical laboratory technician where a patientâ€™s health depended on the accuracy of what I observed through my microscope. I was a perfectionist in that role and I am a perfectionist today in my design work.</p>
              <p class="mb-0">With the strong encouragement of friends and family, I have launched my own business after working as a volunteer to create decorations for festive tables and celebrations of many types, including the Persian New Year. The materials I use are always of the highest quality. My goal is to make your design dreams come true for your happy and special day.</p>
